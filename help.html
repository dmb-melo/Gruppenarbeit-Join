            <h2 class="second-headline-legal-help-privacy">What is Join?</h2>
            <span class="text">
              <span class="blue-words">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the
              Developer Akademie.
            </span>
            <span class="text">
              Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
              <span class="blue-words">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
            </span>
            <span class="text">

                  <span>
                    In <span class="blue-words">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required
                    information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.

                  <span>
                    Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                    task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.

                      Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting
                      cards, as this action is irreversible.
